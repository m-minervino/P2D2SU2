P2D2SU2, by Mauro MINERVINO


This consists in a set of two elementary codes that perform grid coarsening and conversion to SU2 native format, from a PLOT2D file generated by the program CONSTRUCT2D (available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/construct2d/).


CONSTRUCT2D is a convenient tool to generate two-dimensional structured meshes around aerofoils.
A common case is the C-grid mesh, for aerofoils with zero-thickness trailing edge.


The first code (COARSEN_P2D) reads in the PLOT3D file containing the mesh (as generated by CONSTRUCT2D) and a second integer argument (n>=1) that specified the number of grid nodes to be skipped along each block direction from the original mesh file.
The code then provides, as an output, a new PLOT3D grid file, containing the coarsened mesh. This is useful in performing mesh sensitivities studies, generating coarser grid levels from a reference fine mesh.
Usage is as follows:

COARSEN_P2D input_file n


The second code (CONVERT2SU2) reads in the PLOT3D file containing the mesh (it can be either a direct output from CONSTRUCT2D or a coarsened mesh file from COARSEN_P2D) and a second real argument (scale_f) that specifies the grid scaling to be applied to the output.
The code then provides, as an output, a new grid file in the native format used by the Stanford University Unstructured (SU2) suite (https://su2code.github.io/), which can be used for example to simulate the flow-field around the selected aerofoil using its flow solver module (SU2_CFD).
Usage is as follows:
